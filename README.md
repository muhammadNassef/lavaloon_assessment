### Morse code decoding challenge

a task to decode Morse code from a binary signal. The challenge involves implementing two functions:

Functions

1. decodeBits(bits: str) -> str
   
    - Converts a string of bits into Morse code.
3. decodeMorse(morse_code: str) -> str
   
    - Converts Morse code into a readable English message.
